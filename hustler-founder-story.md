# Hustler Founder Story — Building CreatorSphere on $0

I built CreatorSphere using a fully free, open‑source, zero‑cost stack.

- Free hosting (Render, Vercel, Netlify)
- Free databases (Supabase, Neon)
- Free design tools (Figma)
- Free AI models (HuggingFace, open LLMs)
- Free analytics, free dashboards, free marketing tools

I didn’t wait for capital. I used what I had:
- Time
- Curiosity
- Resourcefulness
- Ability to execute — scrappy

Your investment doesn’t fund the idea. It accelerates a system I’ve already worked to bring to life.

This repo — code + docs — is proof.
